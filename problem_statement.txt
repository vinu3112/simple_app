Idea: Build an associative store application with following specification
	1. Start server/Start event handler 
	2. Stop server
	3. Add user (Name,email_id)
	4. Remove user
	5. Find user (Name)
	6. Show All user 

Work:	
Assoc_store_app: Will create a list of user registered and on Remove user delete user from that list and notify handler.
Event_handler: On addition and deletion of user it create a log for that.

Supervison:
A supervisor will be there to supervise the App. If app fails it start it again using one_for_one policy.

yeah 
this how we do
